# Hello there! My name is Nilesh Ade. 🤓 

I'm a Data Scientist and Data Analyst from India. I have a background in M.Sc. Statistics. I'm passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. When I'm not analyzing any data, you can find me on LinkedIn, watching movies and playing games. But most of my days are spent working on projects while listening to slow background music.
